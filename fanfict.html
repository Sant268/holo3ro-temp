            HoloH3ro Forever
        </h1>
        <p>Author: Chanton Mors</p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Being beside each other does make a difference after all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kaela, Kobo, and Zeta busy themselves gawking and kicking their excited feet together 
            every time they hear the raptures beaming through the curtain concealing their presence. 
            At the far front of it lies their fans eagerly waiting for the blast of the trio. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is their time to shine on the stage for the second anniversary.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúWe got this, yeah!‚Äù Kobo‚Äôs voice shrieks, her eyes daring. Just being here backstage already makes her excited!
        </p>
        <p>
            Which contradicts Zeta‚Äôs tremble. ‚ÄúY-Yeah.‚Äù Turning to look at Kaela relaxing.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to be excited lah.‚Äù The blonde afterwards gives a silent chuckle. 
            Just in time M-Chan calls them with a knowing gesture.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúYeah! We got this!‚Äù Kobo stands up first, craning back wearing a reassuring smile. 
            Excitement in those gleaming eyes goes so well with that tiding ocean hair.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kaela nods, then Zeta profusely follows suit. The blonde tugs her skirt and checks the outfit one last time, 
            and turns to the silver spy to adjust the ribbons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tip toe, tip toe, Kobo ecstatically does so, passing by M-Chan after bowing thanks.
            She approaches the concert stage from the backstage stairs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Bang! Bang! Bang!
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, heroes!‚Äù As soon as Kobo steps out first, 
            the lights of mesmerizing colors poof out along the harmonious confetti gun sounds 
            and the fangirls fanboys joy.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúReady for the anniversary concert?‚Äù Zeta runs closely behind, almost tripping though catch balance like a sly cat.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúI know you do, so let‚Äôs have fun!‚Äù Kaela adds in once the other two form the lineup they have been practicing for months. 
            Now it is time to use their talents and passion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The upbeat song starts to hug the stage! Blaring lights in the tone of blue, silver, 
            and yellow mix together and combust into the greatest ray light! 
        </p>
        <p>
            Kobo hits the schmoove while starting to sing. Zeta watches the rain shaman doing it so easily that she feels her dancing groovy as well. 
            And Kaela of course can‚Äôt be left off the fun. The trio dances and sings evermore a carefree symphony. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The riff of the guitar amps, likewise the electric keyboard revs up. 
            The engine of musical wonders goes alongside. This concert is one to be remembered! 
        </p>
        <p>
            Kobo once strived to be a great rain shaman.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kaela once tried to find the material of happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zeta once had a very secret mission.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, like fate has set a grandiose destination, they have now grown alongside each other. 
            They once were standing somewhere below what they‚Äôd thought was just a dream.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, like fate has set a grandiose destination, they have now grown alongside each other. 
            They once were standing somewhere below what they‚Äôd thought was just a dream.
        </p>
        <p>
            And standing here now against the flashing light in a blend of beautiful colors ‚Äî 
            Kaela, Zeta and Kobo know that they‚Äôre here because they are destined to be. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a thing spoken louder than words. 
            Though if were to utter a word out it can become a harmonious song. Knowing full well how far they‚Äôve come. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now their stories shall be conveyed in this celebration.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúHoloh3ro forever!‚Äù The three shouts in a vocal resonance. 
            The crowd cheers and claps and feels the music melodically pleasing by the seconds.

        <h1>
            An Ode to Holoh3ro
        </h1>
        <p>Author: Raw</p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            A great scientist once said,
            "Peace can't be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding."
        </p>
        <p>
            War can be used as a means to obtain peace. Heroes come and fall along with their glory, 
            but others may deemed them as irrelevant or an arrogant monarch. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Among those legends, three noticeable heroes appeared and they gave an impact to the world. 
            They aren't omniscient beings, nor do they possess an unparalleled power. Actually, they're human‚Ä¶
        </p>
        <p>
            The gray-haired beauty, prim and proper. A secret agent who's rumored to come from the future. 
            Not many know of her past, but her valor is second to none. Renowned as Zeta ‚Äòthe 7th Recruit of the Archive Unit‚Äô, 
            kind and compassionate to her people, yet ruthless and just to her opponent.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúEveryone... Do you believe in coincidences? Being told what to do, bound to a mission my whole life, 
            is a fate that I've long accepted as a secret agent. Thrown back in time, I lost all hope. Eventually, 
            I found a place where I belong, I met people and they're worth dedicating my life to! Fate sure does wonders 
            and it may seem bleak sometimes, but it's not a reason to lose hope. I would never have smiled, if not for those people.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
            The second one, a prodigy with yellow hair, majestic and wise. She derived from an artisan family, 
            with vast knowledge and great skills. She is called Kaela, ‚Äòthe Coolest Blacksmith‚Äô, 
            most admired for her passion and wisdom. Her teachings are simple, but they‚Äôre strong and straight. 
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúDuring my journey, I encountered many losses. I tried to rebel against all the odds, and I failed. 
            Even when I try to meet everyone's expectations, I still fail. 
            It's almost impossible to make everyone happy, and being successful isn't always a joyful occasion. 
            In the pursuit of happiness, knowing your limit and being sincere is necessary. 
            Even in a do or die situation, always believe in the path you choose.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
            The last and the youngest, a young and cheerful lady. Endowed with blue hair that shines like a glimmer on the river surface, 
            complemented with a big heart that touches everyone. Her talent in music and the way she opened up to everyone without disregard, 
            entitled her the name Kobo, ‚Äòthe Master Rain Shaman‚Äô. A true example of never judging a book by its cover.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúHello, everyone. I know that being burnt out and having life problems is inevitable. 
            I may never know how hard your life has been or whether I‚Äôm capable of reaching out to you. 
            I didn't have any right to judge you, but regardless of that, my best wishes upon you. 
            Have faith and cheer up no matter what, because every problem will end at the right time. 
            Let me be your sun to shine your day! Ehek~‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
            Those words still rang true and held upon.
        </p>
        <p>
            We, the people, may never meet them directly. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But, we‚Äôre grateful..
            For knowing our beloved, Holoh3ro.

            A Day of Relaxation      
        </h1>
        <p>Author: Kiva</p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            It‚Äôs a sunny day in Tokyo where a mysterious trio arrived. Not knowing the area, they scouted to find the perfect place to 
            sit back and wind down after a long travel. Those 3 caught the eyes of those who passes by with their unique fashion 
            sense accompanied by the foreign language they were conversing with. Whilst walking, one of them stopped and saw a 
            billboard sign that says 
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúA surprise is coming for 3 days on March 25th - 27th. Mark your calendars‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
            Standing still and giggling she called her 2 friends to see the board 
        </p>   
        <p>
            ‚ÄúKobo, Kaela I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs almost 2 years since the day we met and debuted together‚Äù 
            Said Zeta while staring at the billboard. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Both Kobo and Kaela came to see what made zeta stop 
            and while hearing what she said both of them started to reminisce that faithful day. 
            The trio don‚Äôt want to attract more attention than they already have so they started walking again, 
            aimlessly trying to find a good spot to wind down. While wandering around, Kobo stopped and said 
        </p>
        <p>
	        ‚ÄúHey guys, that place there looks nice let‚Äôs stop and get ourselves a parfait since it‚Äôs sooo hot out.‚Äù 
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúSounds good bo, my feet has been hurting for a while so lets sit back and relax for a bit‚Äù 
            Replied Kaela as the three starts walking towards Cafe KZK.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon entering the cafe, they saw an empty spot and immediately went and sat there. As they sat down a waitress came and gave them the menu and left them to browse the menu. 
            As they flip the pages, a single item caught all of their attention 
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúHey guys this Rainbow Parfait looks so good‚Äù
            Said Kobo to Zeta and Kaela. In which Kaela replied             
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúLets get this to share since it looks soo big, and we each can order a drink for ourselves‚Äù
            <br>Having an agreement with one another Zeta immediately called the waitress to order 
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúGood afternoon, what can i get you all started with today?‚Äù
            Asked the waitress to the trio 
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúGood afternoon to you too, we would like to order the Rainbow Parfait and I‚Äôll take a regular cafe latte‚Äù
            Replied Zeta 
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll have the Red Velvet Shake with the Blueberry Frosting‚Äù Kobo Followed
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll Finish the order with Tropical Sunrise Punch‚Äù Finished by Kaela
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúAlright I have your orders noted, I‚Äôll be back with your orders soon‚Äù Replied by the Waitress. 
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe it guys, 2 years since our debut. It feels like we were the kouhai‚Äôs 
            but now we are the one who have kouhai‚Äôs‚Äù
            <br>
            Kaela said to Kobo and Zeta while reminiscing their debut days
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúIkr, it feels so unreal me being a senpai even though people keep calling me bocil maut.‚Äù 
            Replied Kobo feeling abit worked up
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúEverything aside, we have our fans to thank. Without them we couldn‚Äôt be here laughing and enjoying the way things turned out.‚Äù
            Zeta replied in a grateful tone. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst chatting, the waitress came back with their orders <br>
            ‚ÄúSorry for the wait but here are your orders: 1 Rainbow Parfait, 1 Cafe Latte, 1 Red Velvet shake with the Blueberry Frosting, and lastly 1 Tropical Sunrise Punch. If you need anything else don‚Äôt hesitate to call for me. Enjoy.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù
            Replied everyone simultaneously. 
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúLooking back if we 3 didn‚Äôt debuted, we wouldn‚Äôt be enjoying a day like this, so for that Happy 2 Year Anniversary to us.‚Äù
            Kaela says energetically to Kobo and Zeta
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúHehehe, I look forward to more years of HoloH3ro, Happy 2 Year Anniv.‚Äù
            Kobo replied
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúMe too Happy 2 Year Anniversary and to more years ahead‚Äù Replied Zeta.
        </p>
        <p>
            With that, the trio ended up spending the day chilling and reminiscing of the past 2 years, throughout the ups and downs, the joyful moments as well as the sorrowful moments, the three shared a day with each other. Looking forward only those 3 knows the path each of them paved for themselves. What does the future hold? Will their fans still enjoy watching them? Are amongst the few question that arises but, one thing is for sure‚Ä¶
